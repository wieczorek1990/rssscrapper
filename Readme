rssscrapper
===========

Tried my best, running fast is hard.

Time spent: 4h

# Issued commands

```
django-admin startproject rssscrapper
python3 manage.py startapp api
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```

# How to test

```
python3 manage.py currency usd
python3 manage.py currency usd pln
python3 manage.py runserver
curl localhost:8000/api/currencies/
```

# Architecture

Django --> DRF --> list route /api/currencies/
|
--> command to load currencies (currency)

# TODO

* dockerization
* safe settings.py
